# Exeter - The Student Project Connect Application

## Executive Summary

Exeter currently has a 91% retention rate for their students throughout three campuses: Phoenix, Seattle, and Online. Exeter would like to maintain and increase their exceptional retention rate by providing a web application linking like-minded students from all three campuses for projects. Our full-stack web development team, Lotus108, will work with Exeter to develop a social media web application to connect their students based upon interest and related student projects. 

## Business Objectives

The first objective Lotus108 will provide to Exeter is a business application platform called Colla that Exeter can market quickly to their students. This platform will provide quality and innovative features to motivate students to engage in using this platform to connect and build better communication. 
Students will be able to log into a collaboration hub to post an idea for a project or search other student's ideas to find something they are interested in working on.
The goal for this web application is for Exeter's students to have the ability to effectively socialize and connect with each other to discuss working together on related projects.  

## Background

In the last three decades, the western society has transitioned from an industrial world to a developed information society. It wasn't too long ago when communication practices concentrated locally, face-to-face and/or through a landline phone. However, in the last ten years mobile phones and the Internet have added even more communication channels. The digital age of today demands for social networking hubs to enhance the social interaction experience. With the great success of mega social media platforms like Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, and Instagram have come the need for more specified market business applications such as Slack to connect like-minded users to collaborate within a team or forum. Slack was launched in 2014 and provides millions of people around the world a collaboration hub that brings users an area to collaborate on work and project ideas. The Colla application (short for collaboration) will provide similar needs of the Slack application: connecting teams, unifying systems, but will specifically attract users for effectively collaborating and sharing ideas on Exeter projects.

## Scope

The project is aimed to provide a central place for organizing, planning, and tracking projects. Through the Colla web application, users should be able to self-organize, create, and share knowledge for individual purposes and collaborative efforts on projects and like-minded ideas. The web application should be compatible with majority of browsers to provide user friendly Interface for all users: Project administrators, project leaders, and project members. As with social networks, relationships and trust are core concepts of Colla applications. To maintain a effective circle of social interaction there will be 3 dimensions of Colla: interaction space, user role, and social context.
Interaction Space: Consumption, lifelong learning, cooperation's/collaboration, creation/self-expression, active citizenship
User Role: Society, local community, personal network, small group, individual
Social Context: interaction between the individual and the mobile device (micro-level)
To enhance interactions with others, Colla should be able to develop the following:
Discussion forums: communities, forums, Q&A- services
Social publishing platforms: blogging and micro-blogging where users create and publish text and media content
Interest-based networks: Social network of like-minded people with similar interests
Private communication: built-in service for secure private communication to keep the user in the Colla application to avoid going to third-party resources.
